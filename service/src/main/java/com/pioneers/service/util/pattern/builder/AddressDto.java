    Look at this steps to build Builder Design PatternðŸ˜™ ðŸ‘‡
    step 1: create an outer class with its fields (AddressDto)
    step 1: create a constructor that take inner class
    step 2: create a static builder method that return inner class (instead of creating new object of inner class in main class)
    step 3: create inner class with the same fields of outer class (AddressDtoBuilder)
    step 4: create a setter for each field and return this (this means inner class) to use it in chain ÙƒØ³Ù„Ø³Ù„Ø© ÙˆØ±Ø§ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¶
    step 5: create a build method that return outer class (instead of creating new object of outer class in main class)
